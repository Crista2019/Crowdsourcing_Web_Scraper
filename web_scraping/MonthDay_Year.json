The number 22 signifies the number of veterans that\n  commit suicide every day. It\u2019s a staggering number and one that we\n  must bring to zero.

SHARE Military Initiative at Shepherd Center is a comprehensive\n  rehabilitation program that focuses on assessment and treatment for\n  service men and women who have sustained a mild to moderate traumatic\n  brain injury and PTSD from the Afghanistan and Iraqi conflicts. 22 will tell the stories of these service\u00a0men and women who\n  volunteered to serve their country as they\u00a0struggle to regain a normal\n  civilian life.

Travel the world lying on bed My name is Tanika de Koning (26 years) My dream is traveling around the world, even though I am handicapped\n  on bed. I believe in making the impossible possible. I have a rare\n  muscular disease, and have been locked up in my room for years. But I\n  am a fighter and I am crazy for my dreams, my passions and my talents.\n  I'm in love with India. India is my dream country where I really want\n  to go. From my childhood I dreamed of it. It makes my heart beat\n  faster, the music makes me happy, the Bollywood movies inspire me. The\n  love for India is almost impossible to explain. My spirit, my heart is\n  there. I believe India will change my life. It's my destiny. Unfortunately, I can not buy a ticket like other people, sit and\n  travel, and just walk in a car or train. Financially, I do not manage\n  to do this. I am trying to find it very hard with savings and things,\n  but after speaking to the organization, I have to pay eight times the\n  airline ticket. I also need at least one supervisor, actually two.\n  People taking care of me, lifting, helping etc. Because I have to pay\n  separately for a stretcher, and because I have to pay for the chairs\n  with the stretcher. And I can not raise that money ... In addition, a special van has to be made in India where I can lay on\n  a bed (a high bed in which I can drive around and sleep). Also,\n  overnight stays must be arranged for a special bed. These are all\n  challenges, and also the financial costs involved. India is obviously\n  not the country like in the Bollywood films. India is so big and so\n  diverse. I want to travel there, but not alone. Bollywood industry In spite of the fact that I am in bed, I want to visit the\n  bollywood the industry, writing scripts, acting, modelling in a\n  variety of areas, and especially not my fashion. I am a high fashion\n  designer and artist. It seems great to me to make beautiful outfits\n  for the movie industry, but also to work with local people, and to\n  start something. Thus, I can share my talents with my dream country. I\n  also design on paper, because if people ask about it, lying on my side\n  with pillows below, but unfortunately I can not sew it. Therefor I\n  need other great people to work together, and make the creations alive. The movie industry has shown interest in me through social media. I\n  have to say that on my photos you often do not see me being sick. But\n  even then people are interested, but they all ask when you come here.\n  This hurts my heart because they do not know how much I like to go to\n  India. That sense of desire for your dream country, to your\n  destination, but it also gives me an additional incentive to combine\n  everything. I also hope with my art, with my talents, toever do it all\n  by myself, and to regain my freedom with this. I also hope to be able to follow courses. For example, you will soon\n  be in the movie industry, and you could learn a lot. In addition, I\n  saw that courses from New York are given this year, wow \u201cSudha Chandran is a exemple of a disabled and actress\u201d Traveling through India Of course next to the Bollywood industry, I want to travel through\n  India and experience the life there, the feeling, the atmosphere, the\n  colors, the scents, the people, the adventures, so you feel you're\n  alive, one with everything. You can visit so many places in India. For\n  me, this would be an additional challenge, as many old buildings, busy\n  traffic, and there must be good roads and private hospitals. But most\n  of all, I would see a lot, but, of course, the magic Taj Mahal.\n  Besides, there are so many beautiful magic spots. Also I have contact\n  with an organization that is just fine for Bollywood industry, so I\n  have to go to Mumbai. I would also like to see nature, but I do not\n  know if this is possible. I am grateful for everything I can see and\n  experience. I hope, of course, to visit some festivals, Diwali or Holi\n  or another, in terms of health, it should be possible, but I'm someone\n  who gives everything. Divya II have one more reason. To meet Divya, my financial adoptive\n  girl. I have a financial adoptive girl in southern India since I was\n  19. Her name is Divya, and I love her, even though we never met. I'm a\n  kind of mother, but more a girlfriend, helper, I have many caps on, we\n  care a lot and I want the very best for her. And super good news:\n  Through my help all those years, she goes to college to do a degree.\n  She is the first of the organization to do this and I am very proud of\n  her, so very proud. She worked so hard and I believe in her and will\n  always believe in her. We have a wish together, and that is to really\n  meet each other. All those years I wrote her that I worked on it, and\n  I do, but unfortunately I did not succeed yet, but I keep on fighting.\n  Because I wish with all my heart and soul that we meet each other. And\n  I could finally give her all my love and support. The organization\n  advised me to let her fly to me re that said to live far away, this\n  can not be funded. So this is the case, but I want this so so when I\n  finally go to India, I will definitely do that and open my arms and\n  finally we can hug each other. Health treatment And not at least my health. If I finally go to my dream country, I\n  want to stay longer. I know they have many things in India for health.\n  I also have a Neuroborriolosis, in India, shows here what has to be\n  done. Ayurveda treatments are also recommended to me. The doctors in\n  the Netherlands gave me up and can not help me anymore, not even minor\n  infections of anything. Therefore, I have to look elsewhere, so I want\n  to grab chances with both hands. And try to at least get relief,\n  especially for the intense pain, that would be something. That would\n  be a great miracle! My father and I My father and I have a special band. Besides being there for me 24/7,\n  picking me up, turning, eating, drinking, etc., our dream has always\n  been to go to India. He also wanted to go to India in his youth, but\n  life was hectic and he did not succeed. Then I was born and thus his\n  love for travel, and especially to Indian areas, became extra strong,\n  as if the other half of my soul lives there sometimes. My father told\n  me about his dream .... he has not been able to travel for years and\n  cares for me. I am so grateful to him, and it is not very good with\n  him in terms of private circumstances. As long as my dad can lift and\n  take care of me, we want to make this trip, because I do not know any\n  other people who can, and he can not afford to do it. He grows older,\n  I'm not getting in better health. My illness is progressively worse\n  every year. If we still want to do this, and I want to give him this,\n  and if he can go to a historic building, but I do not know that\n  there's a super sweet person with me. I probably need somebody to\n  really wash me, but find and arrange for me to help me so that my\n  father can see and see it. So that he lives, I give him that too, it's\n  also his childhood dream. Fashion and more My dream, health, passions and talents, experiences, love. My\n  destination, as you can read. I want to try a lot and get it all out.\n  I also have many fans in India for my work, my artwork, my fashion and\n  more. I would like to try and arrange for them a greeting and\n  greeting. I also hope to arrange a fashion show. I know someone who\n  organizes events, so who knows if I can combine it? I hope so, so that\n  local people can start a business for my foundation to help me, myself\n  and others, to make something awesome with that talent. Psssst,\n  secretly I want to live there hihi, even though I've never been there\n  and I can't endure heat, and it's very hot there ... I hope to find a\n  way I can make a bed with a kind of cooling system, so that I can keep\n  it cool. I finally hope to come to my beloved India, despite pain and\n  disability. I try to leave all my bad things behind me and make a new\n  start in my beloved country. I know it would be intense, and I would\n  have to rest a lot, but it's the country of yoga and gurus. My sweet dogs I have three shih tzu's and they are my everything, my angels on\n  earth, and can not live without them. If I would make a short trip,\n  then they should be kept in a nice spot, but I'm going to my\n  destination, my core dreamland. So I want to go there too. The dogs\n  must come there if this is possible. There are so many reasons I want\n  to go there and there are so many possibilities there, but I have to\n  get there first. This costs a lot of adjustments, wins, knocks,\n  fighting and risks also take health because I've also attacks, and\n  then I'm completely dependent of others, but there are also costs,\n  things have to be created and, as I said, flying is already at least\n  eight times the price, plus the stretcher plus, I have to pay at least\n  one companion, the van, adjusted bed, places of stay, guides, health\n  treatments also cost a lot of money. But I'm so grateful for\n  everything that's going to happen. My thanks would be forever for you,\n  and who knows, I can think of something that, if I can, for the people\n  who want to take you with me a bit, when I talk on social media. Much\n  love, Tanika. I suffer a lot, more then I tell or show, my looks are\n  just looking normal, but I lay down on bed, because my bed is my\n  wheelchair... that is a diffrent story. But I keep strong and will\n  always fight for myself and others.

I'm from Bulgaria and I have\n  recently moved to the country of the unlimited opportunities - The\n  United Stated of America. I'm came here to fulfill my American dream. I have always dreamed of\n  having my own movie theater. I have been working as cinematographer in\n  a cinema and I've seen a lot of things that I could do better, smarter\n  and more efficiently. Here is a description of my business idea. A movie theater, which is also called a cinema is a venue, usually a\n  building that contains an auditorium for viewing films/movies or\n  motion pictures as it is called in some quarters, for the purpose of\n  entertainment or perhaps education. Almost all movie theaters are\n  commercial operations open to the general public, who attend by\n  purchasing a ticket. The Tickets It is not always easy to buy a movie ticket especially when the movie\n  you want to watch is in the caliber of Star wars or Marvel movies. We\n  will have an online system where you can buy your ticket. You will say\n  \u201cOk that is not new every movie theater has that option\u201d, but you will\n  also have the option of choosing where to seat in the hall. Before\n  getting to the stage of paying for your tickets you will see a map of\n  the hall. From this map you choose the best seats available. And it is\n  not only this. You will be able to make a reservation. For example \u2013\n  you want to watch a movie at 6pm but you are not sure you will be able\n  to finish what you are doing before 6pm. You don\u2019t need to buy your\n  ticket and than loose the money because you were not able to come. You\n  will be able to make a reservation, and again choose your seats. You\n  do not need to pay. The only thing you need to do is show up 20\n  minutes before the movie starts, show your reservation number, pay for\n  the tickets and that is it. If you do not show up to get your tickets\n  20 minutes before the movie starts, the system automatically will\n  delete your reservation and you don\u2019t lose money because you did not come. The movie theater it self The movie theater will have 5 fully equipped with the best projection\n  machines. The 1st hall will be a VIP hall. The tickets will be a\n  little bit more expensive compared to standard halls. You will be to\n  lay dawn and watch your movie, even have you own table to put your\n  popcorns, nachos or whatever you got to eat while watching. 2nd\n  hall will be equipped with a 4DX system. This system allows to feel\n  things, like different smells, water, wind, explosions. 3rd hall\n  will be an IMAX hall. This is one of the best options if you are a big\n  fan of 3D movies. 4th and 5th halls will be standard halls.", "url": ["https://fundrazr.com/41MW96"]},

Im Sue Rowe... Practially my whole life I have dreamed of being a\n  singer even before I started acting. I took random voice lessons from\n  a variety of coaches along my way. I studied with a coach from every\n  genre of music including Rock, Gospel/Blues, Jazz, Broadway, Speech\n  Level and a few others. It wasn\u2019t until I hosted a live music show for\n  8 months that I realized I loved Jazz/Blues the best and felt the most\n  freedom when I sang in that style. So I made the move from a lifetime\n  of hopes to be a country singer to singin the Blues... One of my biggest fears I had to overcome was my stage fright. When I\n  started I did not even know how to use a mic. So I frequently went to\n  karaoke bars to learn mic control and before you know it I was\n  entering Karaoke competitions and started to place! I even took 14th\n  at a national level competition with contestants from all over the\n  globe! I was making progress and overcoming my fears at the same time. Now I know most singers get their start when they 20\u2019s or even\n  younger.

At the tender age of 13 I\n  decided to make animation my career, I have been using a primitive 200\n  dollar Bamboo tool so far, but come on guys, it's time to bump it up\n  to the next level and move into more serious hardcore technology so I\n  can put my stone-age tool to rest. Because my mom and I decided that\n  we still would like to eat and wear clothes for the next few months,\n  we thought it would be best to ask for help from people that have\n  money for food, clothes, and a little extra for people like us, and\n  since you're reading this I guess that means you. A professional\n  Cintiq is only 3,000 dollars, but my mom would probably take 3 years\n  to save 3,000 dollars. I need it now, not in 3 years, sorry mom. I\n  would be forever grateful for every 1 dollar, 5 dollar, or 3,000\n  dollar donation that comes in. I might even dedicate one of my\n  characters to you and you will see yourself on the cartoon network\n  between Bugs Bunny and Spongebob. Go ahead, make my day. Wouldn't you\n  like to be an answer to prayer? Be God's little helper and become a\n  cartoon character all at the same time. Help me while I'm still the\n  tender age of 15. Renew my faith in humanity, help the poor suffering\n  children of the world. God bless, and thank you. Amen.", "url": ["https://fundrazr.com/1cXHc"]},
{"campaignTitle": "BANFF MEDIA FESTIVAL MEET WITH NETFLIX", "amountRaised": ["920"], "goal": "of $2k goal", "currencyType": ["Canadian Dollar"], "endDate": "", "numberContributors": ["6"], "story": "My name is Tammy Lynne and I am an Indigenous Filmmaker. I was\n    just accepted to receive $1000 to attend BANFF WORLD MEDIA FESTIVAL\n    through creative B.C. passports to markets fund. This is a great\n    opportunity to kick-start\u00a0many of my film projects in development,\n    plus, find distribution opportunities for my completed documentary\n    film project WHEN THEY TOOK THE CHILDREN. I need the money because\n    my total costs to make this happen is $3690. I have $690 to chip in\n    myself so the total I need is only $2000. Which consists of 1695\n    conference registration, $600 airfare, $400 4 night hotel, 4 days\n    food $240, ground transportation $200, marketing materials $200,\n    overhead $335. I'll be finding ways to scale this back and make sure\n    this happens. Any and all help is super appreciated. . thanks for\n    your time!!! So many of my projects will be supported by this trip including\n    my newest project BENEATH THE WEB (horror/thriller). Which I'll be\n    working on with my daughter. This is a project that is fun and\n    exciting. Which is different from all the emotional work I have been\n    doing. I also have a great animation project called GREY EYES (kinda\n    like a First Nations Harry Potter)created by my wonderful writer\n    friend Frank Busch. I will also be looking for leads for my\n    documentary series THEY NEVER STOPPED TAKING THE CHILDREN. Which\n    takes a look at the international problem of wrongful First Nations\n    child apprehension. A project very close to my heart. This\n    opportunity will get me lunch with decision makers like\u00a0 NETFLIX.\n    I'll also send updates of the progress of my trip!! All donors of\n    $30 or more get a copy of my latest completed documentary WHEN THEY\n    TOOK THE CHILDREN. OR a piece of vintage sterling silver jewelry!!!\n    Any and all help is appreciated!!! Thanks so much for your time!!!", "url": ["https://fundrazr.com/e1M9c7"]}
