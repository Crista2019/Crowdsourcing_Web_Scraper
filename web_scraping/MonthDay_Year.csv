"2,345",Help finish queer Harlem Renaissance music short,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,20,"Shoga Films has been making documentaries about the intresection of race and sexuality for over a
  decade with multiple film festival screening and garnering some awards
  along the way. We are now attempting our most ambitious project yet,
  an historical retrieval of the under-appreciated participation of gays
  and lesbians in the Harlem Renaissance. Unlike our previous films,
  this will require a major budget of well over $200,000. HOWEVER, we
  are starting  with a smaller piece, ""Congo Cabaret,"" that
  will prime the pump for further donations, grant applications, and the
  building of our community and audience. We recently completed a successful Kickstarter campaign to
  (inadequately) cover the costs of production of a short music film
  based on an adaptation of a Harlem Renaissance novel authored by
  Claude McKay, a gay writer of the period. That has been beautifully
  filmed but, we still need funds for post-production: editing,
    sound mixing, color correction, publicity and distribution . “Congo Cabaret” is a short music film based on a slice of Harlem
    Renaissance life from gay writer Claude McKay’s then-bestselling
    novel, Home to Harlem . Adapted by Quincy Gossfield ( The DL Chronicles ) and
    Robert Philipson ( Body and Soul: An American Bridge ),
    ""Congo Cabaret"" beautifully contextualizes  a knock-out
    performance of a Bessie Smith song by rising star Parisa Fitz-Henley
    (NBC's Midnight, Texas ). Featuring veteran actors Kevin
    Daniels ( Modern Family ) and Darryl Stephens ( Noah's
    Arc ), ""Congo Cabaret"" combined lush cinematography
    with finely nuanced acting. You will be amazed at how much this
    (projected) 15-minute short packs into its lean profile. This
    gorgeous footage, the creation of directors Deondray and Quincy
    Gossfield, must come to fruition. Please help us get there! If you can't donate yourself, share this link with those for
    whom the recuperation of Black queer history is important, as well
    as for those who want to support fine independent filmmaking. Shoga Films is a 501(3)c non-profit organizations. All
    donations are tax deductible! Watch our uber talented directors Deondray and Quincy Gossfield talk
  about his joy in bringing out the queer side of the Harlem Renaissance
  through their artistry. And who is this mystery man? Help us raise $ to finish
  post-production, so you can see....",https://fundrazr.com/queerHR1927

    characters to be printed. LAIKA Animation Studios are pioneers of 3D printing technology.

    exhibition of LAIKA's 3D printed puppets and other crafted materials
    used in their films. Not only is it an exceptional example of how 3D
    printing can be used as an art form, but L AIKA studios are
    based in Hillsboro, giving our students exposure to incredible
    art and technology being used locally. We would like to take the students to the LAIKA exhibit to
    inspire their work in 3D printing and character design. This exhibit

"1,085",22: A Film About Veterans,,,,,"Who We are Rescue Doc Films is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit media company committed to producing educational, challenging and socially
    relevant media to strengthen human and animal rights. The Cause In April of 2016, Rescue Docs was honored to document the Shepherd’s
  Men run from Boston to Atlanta. They each ran 22km per day wearing 22
  pounds for 9 days. The number 22 signifies the number of veterans that
  commit suicide every day. It’s a staggering number and one that we
  must bring to zero. We made a short film that chronicled the incredible efforts being
  made by the Shepherd's Men to raise money and awareness for the life
  saving work being done by the SHARE Military Initiative. As soon as we
  met the Shepherd's Men, we knew there was a much larger film that
  needed to be made. That film is 22. SHARE Military Initiative at Shepherd Center is a comprehensive
  rehabilitation program that focuses on assessment and treatment for
  service men and women who have sustained a mild to moderate traumatic
  brain injury and PTSD from the Afghanistan and Iraqi conflicts. 22 will tell the stories of these service men and women who
  volunteered to serve their country as they struggle to regain a normal
  civilian life. It is our hope that this film will let veterans
  struggling with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries know that they are
  not alone and it's OK to ask for help. Making The Film Making this film will require funds for equipment, crew, travel,
  editing, music, graphic design, marketing, festival submission fees,
  and much more. We have a proven track record of making films under
  budget and putting them to work for the causes that need them. How You Can Help We need your help to raise the funds necessary to make this film.
  With perks starting at $10 for a digital download of the film once
  it's completed to $1000 to become an Associate Producer of the film,
  there are ways that anyone can help. We also depend on you to share
  the campaign with your friends and family on social media. Thank You! Filmmaking is a collaborative art form, from camera operators to
  donors, every role on the team is imperative. Without your help, we
  simply would not be able to make this vitally important film. Thank you in advance for your consideration, Michael Samstag & Josh Gildrie Rescue Doc Films",https://fundrazr.com/22thefilm
160,Joshua's studio equipment,U.S. Dollar,,of $1.5k goal,4,"My name is Joshua Bradley, I am 15 years old. I’m currently a
    sophomore in high school. I am looking for funding to start creating
    some films. I first gained interest in video making after taking a
    video editing class my freshman year of high school. I currently am
    in need of: two to three cameras, a tripod for each, a backdrop
    stand, lights, and several microphones. With this I will be able to
    make quality videos with the techniques that I have learned. I’m
    extremely excited to get started! Some kids could receive these items in a series of Christmas and
    or birthday presents, but when you grow up in a family with 10
    children like me anything that you get is either a hand-me-down that
    has gone through a couple of your siblings, or it comes from a
    thrift store (mainly from the Goodwill). I work hard when I’m not at school, but it’s not to earn money.
    Every day after school I am either babysitting my younger siblings
    or my 2 and 3 year old nieces, taking care of my family’s 126
    rabbits (recently went up to 134 with the birth of the birth of two
    more litters), 14 pigs, 4 chickens, 9 dogs, and a cat (I only
    approve of the cat), or in the summer working landscaping jobs with
    my dad. The work I do with my dad helps pay for my clothes from
    Goodwill. I'm sorry i got a little off topic, but this fundraiser will be
    able to help me pursue a future in filmmaking, who knows maybe i'll
    make one of the next major films after i go to college and get
    degrees in Film, Animation, Audio, & Entertainment Business.
    Before I can do this I will need to learn as much as I can on my own. Thank you for your contribution, time, and consideration. I look
    forward to sharing the masterpieces I will be able to create with
    your help.",https://fundrazr.com/21Jg36

  myself. Now i cant do that again bcs i only have the money transport
  to go to school. My parents still have to pay off our house.
  They still have to pay for my school fee, course fee, and others. But
  i only live once, i cant just give up like that. i wanted to try my
  best bcs maybe t here are lots of other people out there who may
    want to be myself. I've to be grateful for my life by trying my best. I'll busy studying and practicing for school.. I can't focus on

60,Faith and Family Films Projector/Sound Equipment,U.S. Dollar,,of $7k goal,3,"Faith and Family Films started in 2007 in a small church in New
  Hampshire and has sense expanded to more churches and halls in
  Vermont. As we seek to expand our reach we need your help. Hollywood
  is not interested in bringing good family and faith based
  entertainment to the nation, we look to fix that problem, at least in
  the New England area by offering films that may otherwise never get
  seen in this area. There are many small churches that cannot show films due to not
  having the proper equipment to do so. Our goal is to have our own
  equiptment to travel with so we can bring films like ""God's Not
  Dead"", ""Polycarp"", ""Herbie"", ""Welcome to
  Inspiration"", ""Heaven Is For Real"", ""Hoovey""
  and other great films to those who may not have the opportunity to see
  them otherwise. All of these films have been shown in the past and our
  future plans are to offer films like ""Do You Believe?"",
  ""The Faith of Our Fathers"", ""War Room"" and many
  other lesser known but just as good films to audiences aound the New
  England area, with a focus on Vermont and New Hampshire. We have had one organization in Vermont that recently cursed us
  during shows and purposly blocked the entrace so patrons could not
  attend or felt intimidated if they pushed by. this has not stopped our
  showings and is making our company stronger in its resolve to bring
  these films to the public. God has a bigger plan for this ministry and
  we already have had other churches step in to fill the void and we
  will continue to seek out more. Naturally we need to pay the royalties on each film, and in most
  cases we ask for a love offering which helps us cover expenses, and
  that's about all we do, cover our expenses. This is why we need your help. In 2015 we will have at least 37 showings of different films in
  different locations around NH and VT and we hope to add more! VT is
  currently considered the least religious, or most secular, state in
  the union. Please consider helping us with this great task at hand to spread
  Gods Word through film to more and more people. We currently do not
  charge any admission for our screenings, however we do ask for a love
  offering to help cover expenses, which they do in most cases. this is

0,Tanika Travel disabelt on bed around the world,Euro,,of €100k goal,0,"My dream. Travel the world lying on bed My name is Tanika de Koning (26 years) My dream is traveling around the world, even though I am handicapped
  on bed. I believe in making the impossible possible. I have a rare
  muscular disease, and have been locked up in my room for years. But I
  am a fighter and I am crazy for my dreams, my passions and my talents.
  I'm in love with India. India is my dream country where I really want
  to go. From my childhood I dreamed of it. It makes my heart beat
  faster, the music makes me happy, the Bollywood movies inspire me. The
  love for India is almost impossible to explain. My spirit, my heart is
  there. I believe India will change my life. It's my destiny. Unfortunately, I can not buy a ticket like other people, sit and
  travel, and just walk in a car or train. Financially, I do not manage
  to do this. I am trying to find it very hard with savings and things,
  but after speaking to the organization, I have to pay eight times the
  airline ticket. I also need at least one supervisor, actually two.
  People taking care of me, lifting, helping etc. Because I have to pay
  separately for a stretcher, and because I have to pay for the chairs
  with the stretcher. And I can not raise that money ... In addition, a special van has to be made in India where I can lay on
  a bed (a high bed in which I can drive around and sleep). Also,
  overnight stays must be arranged for a special bed. These are all
  challenges, and also the financial costs involved. India is obviously
  not the country like in the Bollywood films. India is so big and so
  diverse. I want to travel there, but not alone. Bollywood industry In spite of the fact that I am in bed, I want to visit the
  bollywood the industry, writing scripts, acting, modelling in a
  variety of areas, and especially not my fashion. I am a high fashion
  designer and artist. It seems great to me to make beautiful outfits
  for the movie industry, but also to work with local people, and to
  start something. Thus, I can share my talents with my dream country. I
  also design on paper, because if people ask about it, lying on my side
  with pillows below, but unfortunately I can not sew it. Therefor I
  need other great people to work together, and make the creations alive. The movie industry has shown interest in me through social media. I
  have to say that on my photos you often do not see me being sick. But
  even then people are interested, but they all ask when you come here.
  This hurts my heart because they do not know how much I like to go to
  India. That sense of desire for your dream country, to your
  destination, but it also gives me an additional incentive to combine
  everything. I also hope with my art, with my talents, toever do it all
  by myself, and to regain my freedom with this. I also hope to be able to follow courses. For example, you will soon
  be in the movie industry, and you could learn a lot. In addition, I
  saw that courses from New York are given this year, wow “Sudha Chandran is a exemple of a disabled and actress” Traveling through India Of course next to the Bollywood industry, I want to travel through
  India and experience the life there, the feeling, the atmosphere, the
  colors, the scents, the people, the adventures, so you feel you're
  alive, one with everything. You can visit so many places in India. For
  me, this would be an additional challenge, as many old buildings, busy
  traffic, and there must be good roads and private hospitals. But most
  of all, I would see a lot, but, of course, the magic Taj Mahal.
  Besides, there are so many beautiful magic spots. Also I have contact
  with an organization that is just fine for Bollywood industry, so I
  have to go to Mumbai. I would also like to see nature, but I do not
  know if this is possible. I am grateful for everything I can see and
  experience. I hope, of course, to visit some festivals, Diwali or Holi
  or another, in terms of health, it should be possible, but I'm someone
  who gives everything. Divya II have one more reason. To meet Divya, my financial adoptive
  girl. I have a financial adoptive girl in southern India since I was
  19. Her name is Divya, and I love her, even though we never met. I'm a
  kind of mother, but more a girlfriend, helper, I have many caps on, we
  care a lot and I want the very best for her. And super good news:
  Through my help all those years, she goes to college to do a degree.
  She is the first of the organization to do this and I am very proud of
  her, so very proud. She worked so hard and I believe in her and will
  always believe in her. We have a wish together, and that is to really
  meet each other. All those years I wrote her that I worked on it, and
  I do, but unfortunately I did not succeed yet, but I keep on fighting.
  Because I wish with all my heart and soul that we meet each other. And
  I could finally give her all my love and support. The organization
  advised me to let her fly to me re that said to live far away, this
  can not be funded. So this is the case, but I want this so so when I
  finally go to India, I will definitely do that and open my arms and
  finally we can hug each other. Health treatment And not at least my health. If I finally go to my dream country, I
  want to stay longer. I know they have many things in India for health.
  I also have a Neuroborriolosis, in India, shows here what has to be
  done. Ayurveda treatments are also recommended to me. The doctors in
  the Netherlands gave me up and can not help me anymore, not even minor
  infections of anything. Therefore, I have to look elsewhere, so I want
  to grab chances with both hands. And try to at least get relief,
  especially for the intense pain, that would be something. That would
  be a great miracle! My father and I My father and I have a special band. Besides being there for me 24/7,
  picking me up, turning, eating, drinking, etc., our dream has always
  been to go to India. He also wanted to go to India in his youth, but
  life was hectic and he did not succeed. Then I was born and thus his
  love for travel, and especially to Indian areas, became extra strong,
  as if the other half of my soul lives there sometimes. My father told
  me about his dream .... he has not been able to travel for years and
  cares for me. I am so grateful to him, and it is not very good with
  him in terms of private circumstances. As long as my dad can lift and
  take care of me, we want to make this trip, because I do not know any
  other people who can, and he can not afford to do it. He grows older,
  I'm not getting in better health. My illness is progressively worse
  every year. If we still want to do this, and I want to give him this,
  and if he can go to a historic building, but I do not know that
  there's a super sweet person with me. I probably need somebody to
  really wash me, but find and arrange for me to help me so that my
  father can see and see it. So that he lives, I give him that too, it's
  also his childhood dream. Fashion and more My dream, health, passions and talents, experiences, love. My
  destination, as you can read. I want to try a lot and get it all out.
  I also have many fans in India for my work, my artwork, my fashion and
  more. I would like to try and arrange for them a greeting and
  greeting. I also hope to arrange a fashion show. I know someone who
  organizes events, so who knows if I can combine it? I hope so, so that
  local people can start a business for my foundation to help me, myself
  and others, to make something awesome with that talent. Psssst,
  secretly I want to live there hihi, even though I've never been there
  and I can't endure heat, and it's very hot there ... I hope to find a
  way I can make a bed with a kind of cooling system, so that I can keep
  it cool. I finally hope to come to my beloved India, despite pain and
  disability. I try to leave all my bad things behind me and make a new
  start in my beloved country. I know it would be intense, and I would
  have to rest a lot, but it's the country of yoga and gurus. My sweet dogs I have three shih tzu's and they are my everything, my angels on
  earth, and can not live without them. If I would make a short trip,
  then they should be kept in a nice spot, but I'm going to my
  destination, my core dreamland. So I want to go there too. The dogs
  must come there if this is possible. There are so many reasons I want
  to go there and there are so many possibilities there, but I have to
  get there first. This costs a lot of adjustments, wins, knocks,
  fighting and risks also take health because I've also attacks, and
  then I'm completely dependent of others, but there are also costs,
  things have to be created and, as I said, flying is already at least
  eight times the price, plus the stretcher plus, I have to pay at least
  one companion, the van, adjusted bed, places of stay, guides, health
  treatments also cost a lot of money. But I'm so grateful for
  everything that's going to happen. My thanks would be forever for you,
  and who knows, I can think of something that, if I can, for the people
  who want to take you with me a bit, when I talk on social media. Much
  love, Tanika. I suffer a lot, more then I tell or show, my looks are
  just looking normal, but I lay down on bed, because my bed is my
  wheelchair... that is a diffrent story. But I keep strong and will
  always fight for myself and others. Go follow your dreams! you can also donate on the foundation (stichtingtanika) with

15,STAR CINEMA,U.S. Dollar,,of $1.5M goal,2,"Hello, My name is Christiyan  Hristov Ivanov. I'm from Bulgaria and I have
  recently moved to the country of the unlimited opportunities - The
  United Stated of America. I'm came here to fulfill my American dream. I have always dreamed of
  having my own movie theater. I have been working as cinematographer in
  a cinema and I've seen a lot of things that I could do better, smarter
  and more efficiently. Here is a description of my business idea. A movie theater, which is also called a cinema is a venue, usually a
  building that contains an auditorium for viewing films/movies or
  motion pictures as it is called in some quarters, for the purpose of
  entertainment or perhaps education. Almost all movie theaters are
  commercial operations open to the general public, who attend by
  purchasing a ticket. The Tickets It is not always easy to buy a movie ticket especially when the movie
  you want to watch is in the caliber of Star wars or Marvel movies. We
  will have an online system where you can buy your ticket. You will say
  “Ok that is not new every movie theater has that option”, but you will
  also have the option of choosing where to seat in the hall. Before
  getting to the stage of paying for your tickets you will see a map of
  the hall. From this map you choose the best seats available. And it is
  not only this. You will be able to make a reservation. For example –
  you want to watch a movie at 6pm but you are not sure you will be able
  to finish what you are doing before 6pm. You don’t need to buy your
  ticket and than loose the money because you were not able to come. You
  will be able to make a reservation, and again choose your seats. You
  do not need to pay. The only thing you need to do is show up 20
  minutes before the movie starts, show your reservation number, pay for
  the tickets and that is it. If you do not show up to get your tickets
  20 minutes before the movie starts, the system automatically will
  delete your reservation and you don’t lose money because you did not come. The movie theater it self The movie theater will have 5 fully equipped with the best projection
  machines. The 1st hall will be a VIP hall. The tickets will be a
  little bit more expensive compared to standard halls. You will be to
  lay dawn and watch your movie, even have you own table to put your
  popcorns, nachos or whatever you got to eat while watching. 2nd
  hall will be equipped with a 4DX system. This system allows to feel
  things, like different smells, water, wind, explosions. 3rd hall
  will be an IMAX hall. This is one of the best options if you are a big
  fan of 3D movies. 4th and 5th halls will be standard halls.",https://fundrazr.com/41MW96
0,Gotta SING - Never to late to live a DREAM,U.S. Dollar,,of $7.5k goal,0,"Hi! Im Sue Rowe... Practially my whole life I have dreamed of being a
  singer even before I started acting. I took random voice lessons from
  a variety of coaches along my way. I studied with a coach from every
  genre of music including Rock, Gospel/Blues, Jazz, Broadway, Speech
  Level and a few others. It wasn’t until I hosted a live music show for
  8 months that I realized I loved Jazz/Blues the best and felt the most
  freedom when I sang in that style. So I made the move from a lifetime
  of hopes to be a country singer to singin the Blues... One of my biggest fears I had to overcome was my stage fright. When I
  started I did not even know how to use a mic. So I frequently went to
  karaoke bars to learn mic control and before you know it I was
  entering Karaoke competitions and started to place! I even took 14th
  at a national level competition with contestants from all over the
  globe! I was making progress and overcoming my fears at the same time. Now I know most singers get their start when they 20’s or even
  younger. But I was rasing babies and had a few other challenges... my
  story is an interesting one... prehaps for a different day or for a
  book later on. After all, I am still writing my story and you are
  helping me to write it...  I’m 44 now and I just wrote my first song!
  I won the battle to be ME and never gave up! I never thought it was
  possible to be where I am now. I want to show everyone out there, it
  is never to late to Live your Life. Now that my big battle is a war of
  my past life lived, I’m ready share my heart and soul through my
  music, music videos and even my feature films soon to come... I have found the right producer to make these songs into ones that
  will be lasting impressions. This first push will be for the first
  recording session. We have the band all fired up and ready to record.
  The recording session for the first three songs will be $7,500. The funding will go towards the following... Title: ”LOVE IN FOUR CORNERS” 1 Day Recording Drums, Hornes, Upright Base, Guitarist, Rhythm 2,500 Studio Time Mixing Mastering 2,000 Vocal Recording 1 Day Mixing Mastering w/track 1,000 Producer to oversee entire production 1,500 Promotions for Final EP Music only 500 If I am able to get over the ammount I need I will start putting it
  towards my Video Production budget for a professionally recoded music video. For all you that contribute we will be having a 1920’s themed Jam
  later on this summer to launch the EP and you will have the exclusive
  invitation and pre show invites! Can’t wait to see you all there! Thank you for being my friends and most of all for believing in my
  Dreams. I have the best group of friends on this planet that a gal
  could ask for ❤️",https://fundrazr.com/GottaSing

  working well below their standard rates, all because they believe in
  this story. What is our budget for? The crew is working below their standard rate, but we are shooting
  multiple days and need to compensate them for their expertise and
  work. We need to budget in insurance for our film equipment, and need

25,Kickstart my Animation Career - I need a Cintiq!!,Canadian Dollar,,of $3k goal,2,"3 years ago at the tender age of 11 I found an animation website and
  taught myself how to animate. Art talent runs in my family. I have
  BugsBunny and Walt Disney in my veins. At the tender age of 13 I
  decided to make animation my career, I have been using a primitive 200
  dollar Bamboo tool so far, but come on guys, it's time to bump it up
  to the next level and move into more serious hardcore technology so I
  can put my stone-age tool to rest. Because my mom and I decided that
  we still would like to eat and wear clothes for the next few months,
  we thought it would be best to ask for help from people that have
  money for food, clothes, and a little extra for people like us, and
  since you're reading this I guess that means you. A professional
  Cintiq is only 3,000 dollars, but my mom would probably take 3 years
  to save 3,000 dollars. I need it now, not in 3 years, sorry mom. I
  would be forever grateful for every 1 dollar, 5 dollar, or 3,000
  dollar donation that comes in. I might even dedicate one of my
  characters to you and you will see yourself on the cartoon network
  between Bugs Bunny and Spongebob. Go ahead, make my day. Wouldn't you
  like to be an answer to prayer? Be God's little helper and become a
  cartoon character all at the same time. Help me while I'm still the
  tender age of 15. Renew my faith in humanity, help the poor suffering
  children of the world. God bless, and thank you. Amen.",https://fundrazr.com/1cXHc
